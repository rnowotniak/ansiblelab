# ansiblelab
Personal Ansible playground (based on Docker, Docker-composer, Centos8)

Contact: Robert Nowotniak <rnowotniak@gmail.com>

Tested on ArchLinux as the Docker host.

## Quick start

Download the image from my
[Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/rnowotniak) account, and clone this from my
[github](https://github.com/rnowotniak/ansiblelab)
(which allows to rebuild the same image yourself from scratch):

    docker pull rnowotniak/ansiblelab
    git clone https://github.com/rnowotniak/ansiblelab

Create ssh keys which will be used to communicate betwen the master and the nodes in your new Ansible lab:

    cd ansiblelab
    ssh-keygen -q -N "" -f keys/ansiblekey

Start the containers with docker-compose per the definitions in docker-compose.yml:

    docker-compose up

![compose-up](img/docker-compose-up.png)

## Working with the lab environment

Having the master and the nodes up and running (docker-compose up), you can enter the master container and run Ansible commands on the nodes.
A very basic configuration (ansible.cfg) and inventory ("inventory" file) is already copied there in the working directory.

There are 5 hosts in the default inventory (ansiblelab_node_1,
..., ansible_node_5).
To target hosts 1, 2 and 3 with Ansible ping module, run:

![ping3](img/ping3.png)

With just 3 nodes containers present, ping module will show error on 2 nodes if all 5 from the inventory are targetted:

![ping5](img/ping5.png)

To scale the number of hosts to 5 manually, you can use **"docker-compose up -d --scale node=5"** command as follows:

![scale-to-5](img/scale-to-5.png)

Run some shell command (Ansible "shell" module) on all 5 nodes from the inventory (query the host hostname, executive user ID, and uname):

![shell5](img/shell5.png)

To shutdown gracefully and cleanup everthing:

![shutdown](img/shutdown.png)

## A few useful commands

* ansible all -m ping
* ansible all -m ping -i inv
* ansible ...  -o
* ansible ...  -f 5  (fork,  run in parallel)
* ansible ...  -B ... -P 0  (async)
* ansible ...  -m async_status -a jid=....
* ansible-playbook
* ansible all -m shell -a "uname -a" --ask-pass
* docker run -v $PWD/keys:/keys:ro -it --name ansible_node2 -h ansible_node2 --rm anstmp
* docker run -v $PWD/keys:/root/.ssh -it centos
* docker build -t account/imagename .

Some Ansible modules:
* user
* copy
* fetch
* slurp
* setup  (shows facts)
* service
* shell
* command
* unarchive
* raw
* async_status

Example playbook YAML file:

    ---
    - name: My playbook
      hosts: ansiblelab_node_*
      tasks:
        - name: get /etc/hostname file
          fetch:
            src: /etc/hostname
            dest: /tmp/fetched
